# A USELESS README

So this little game is the second time i -failed- tried making a game, it's... better than a year ago i guess, not by much tho lol. So this project was basically for me to get used to rust syntax, weird features and quirks, etc. Not all of them, of course, but almost all the practical things that i have picked up while writing this game i use in other dev projects, so it didn't go to waste i suppose.

## HOW TO INSTALL

I'll write a `bash` script soon i suppose lol
